#: description: Transverse momentum dependence of inclusive J/$\psi$ $v_2$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV for the 20-40% centrality class (mid-rapidity). The first uncertainty (stat) is statistical, the second (sys,uncorrel) is the uncorrelated systematic, while the third one (sys,correl) is a $p_{\rm T}$-correlated systematic uncertainty.
