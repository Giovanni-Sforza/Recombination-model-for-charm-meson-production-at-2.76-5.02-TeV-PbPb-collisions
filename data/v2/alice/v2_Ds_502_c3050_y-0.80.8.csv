#: description: $v_2$ vs. $p_{\rm T}$ of  $D_s^+$ mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$=5.02 TeV in the centrality class 30-50% in the rapidity interval |$y$|<0.8.
The second (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the B feed-down contribution.
The first (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the other sources.
