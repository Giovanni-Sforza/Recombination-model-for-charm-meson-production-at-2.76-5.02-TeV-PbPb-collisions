#: description: $p_{\rm T}$-differential yield of prompt ${\rm D}^{0}$ mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76~{\rm TeV}$  in the centrality class 30-50% in the rapidity interval |y|<0.5.
Branching ratio of ${\rm D}^{0}$->${\rm K}^{0}\pi^{+}$ : 0.0388.
The second (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the B feed-down contribution.
The first (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the other sources.
