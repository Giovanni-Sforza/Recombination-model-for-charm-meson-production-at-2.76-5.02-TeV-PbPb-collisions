#: description: $p_{\rm T}$-differential yield of prompt D$_s^+$ mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV in the centrality class 20-50% in the rapidity interval |y|<0.5.
Branching ratio of D$_s^+$->$\phi\pi^+$->$K^+K^-\pi^+$ : 0.0224.
The second (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the B feed-down contribution.
The first (sys) error is the systematic uncertainty from the other sources.
