#: description: Transverse momentum distributions d$N$/(d$y$d$p_{\mathrm{T}}$) of prompt D$^{0}$ (left) meson in the 0-10% (crosses) centrality classes in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV in |y|<0.5. The uncertainties on the BRs are quoted separately and the horizontal bars represent bin widths. Branching ratio of D$^0$ --> K$\pi$ = 0.0395
